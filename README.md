This is my first attempt at learning git while learning python. I am pretty sure that is an insane thing to do, but I think it's valuable to create good habits. Though I doubt this will be something someone out there reads---if you do please let me know if I am using bad conventions or if you have feedback regarding anything I've done here.

My hope is to document this process in a way that will be amenable to novices at both python and git, so I will try to document anything that brought me pain and likewise, any triumphs I encounter.
